Optimized Employee Bus Routes Using Clustering and Route
Optimization :Developed a Python solution to optimize bus routes
for employees by clustering locations with KMeans and refining
routes using MST and 2-opt algorithms. Visualized the optimized
routes on interactive maps with Folium, enhancing transportation
efficiency and reducing travel distance. Technologies used
included Python, Pandas, NumPy, SciPy, scikit-learn, Folium, and
NetworkX.
